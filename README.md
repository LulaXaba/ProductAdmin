The Product Management System is a web application designed to facilitate the management of products within an e-commerce or inventory management context. The system allows users to add, view, update, and delete products from a database, providing a user-friendly interface for managing product information.

**Key Features:**

1. **Product Listing:** The system displays a list of products retrieved from a database. Each product is presented as a card, containing details such as the product name, description, price, and an image. Users can easily browse through the products using a responsive and visually appealing layout.

2. **Add Product:** Users can add new products to the system by entering details such as the product name, description, price, and uploading an image. Upon submission, the product details are validated and stored in the database.

3. **Update Product:** Existing product details can be updated through the system's interface. Users can modify product attributes, such as the name, description, and price, and save the changes to the database.

4. **Delete Product:** The system provides a mass delete functionality, allowing users to select multiple products using checkboxes and delete them simultaneously. Upon confirmation, the selected products are removed from the database.

5. **User-Friendly Interface:** The system's user interface is designed with a responsive and intuitive layout. It features navigation elements like a product listing page, buttons for adding and deleting products, and a visually appealing design that enhances the user experience.

6. **Database Integration:** The system interacts with a backend database to store and retrieve product information. MySQL is used as the database management system to securely manage product data.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap framework
- **Back-End:** PHP for server-side scripting
- **Database:** MySQL for data storage and retrieval
- **AJAX:** Used for asynchronous communication between the client and server
- **JavaScript:** To enhance interactivity and handle dynamic behavior

**Workflow:**

1. The system fetches product data from the database and displays it on the product listing page.
2. Users can add new products by filling out the required details and submitting the form.
3. Existing products can be updated by clicking on the respective product card and making changes.
4. Users can select multiple products using checkboxes and initiate the mass delete process.
5. Upon confirming the deletion, the selected product cards are removed from the listing and a request is sent to the server to delete the products from the database.

**Benefits:**

- **Efficient Management:** The system streamlines the process of managing products, enabling quick addition, modification, and deletion of items.
- **Improved User Experience:** The intuitive interface and interactive features enhance the user experience and reduce the learning curve.
- **Error Handling:** The system incorporates validation mechanisms to ensure that accurate and complete product data is entered.
- **Data Integrity:** The database ensures the reliability and consistency of product information.

The Product Management System simplifies the tasks of managing product information, helping businesses maintain an organized inventory and provide a seamless shopping experience for customers.
